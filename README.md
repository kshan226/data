Whickham contingency table data for smokers and survivorship
Description
Appleton et al. (1996) summarized a study from the Whickham district of England to quantify the association of smoking, age, and death. 1,314 women were interviewed in the early 1970s with respect to their smoking habits. Twenty years later the women were relocated and classified with respect to survival at the time of the follow up (yes or no), whether they smoked at the time of the original interview (yes or no), and age at the time of the original study (1 = 18-24, 2 = 35-64, 3 = >65).
